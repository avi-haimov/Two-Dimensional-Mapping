# Two Dimensional Mapping by using Single Ultrasonic Sensor

Final project as part of an introduction to embedded software and applications course, submitted by Yarin Ifargan and Avi Haimov.

The project combined several fields such as - hardware, software, and robotics, based on an article from Delhi Technological University for Women. We developed a tool that controls a mobile robot, receives information, processes it, and presents a mapping of the environment.
we had to implement two main programs - an embedded software that defines the movement of the robot, receives the data from the sensor, processes it, and sends it to the computer via Bluetooth, and also a user interface that receives the data, stores it , and finally build the mapping.
